# XmonadConfig
My configs for Xmonad (wallpaper included)

## Usage
To use my configs for Xmonad, git clone this repo, then move the files in the `XmoandConfig` folder to your `.xmonad` folder, backing up its contents beforehand.

## Custom keybinds
I kept most of the keybinds as default, but I *did* set `ctrl+z` to restart and `ctrl+x` to shutdown.
